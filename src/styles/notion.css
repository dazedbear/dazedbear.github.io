/**
 * This file contains site-specifc style overrides for Notion elements from
 * react-notion-x.
 * 
 * react-notion-x's goal is to match styling as close as possible to Notion,
 * whereas our goal with this site is to adjust Notion's styling in a few key
 * places to add some flare.
 *
 * See the all styles defined in react-notion-x.
 * https://github.com/NotionX/react-notion-x/blob/master/packages/react-notion-x/src/styles.css
 *
 * We use tailwind's feature 'extracting components class with @apply' to override the Notion styles.
 * https://tailwindcss.com/docs/extracting-components#extracting-component-classes-with-apply
