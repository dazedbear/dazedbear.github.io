## Storybook

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) helps you build UI components in isolation from your app's business logic, data, and context.
That makes it easy to develop hard-to-reach states. Save these UI states as **stories** to revisit during development, testing, or QA.
We recommend building UIs with a [**component-driven**](https://componentdriven.org) process starting with atomic components and ending with pages.

## Chromatic

[Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/) automates gathering UI feedback, visual testing, and documentation, so developers can iterate faster with less manual work.

## How to contribute

Please write/view codes in the `src/stories` directory.
